Simple function chain module

Runs a chain of functions in series, each passing their results to the next.
If an error object found among arguments and error callback is specified, the next function is not executed
and the error callback is immediately called with
the error. Also supports one this object threw whole chain.

## Usage

* `tire(fn, thisArg , errorCallback)(fn)(fn);`
* **fn** - A first and next functions to be run.
* **thisArg** - An object that will be used for this [optional].
* **errorCallback** - An callback to be run on error [optional].

##### Example

```javascript
tire(function (next) {
  fs.exists(path, next);
}, done)
(function (exists, next) {
  if(!exists) {
    var data = "uuu";
    fs.writeFile(path, data, 'utf-8', next);
  }
})
(function (err, next) {
  fs.readFile(path, 'utf-8', next);
})
(function (err, data, next) {
  fs.unlink(path, next);
})
